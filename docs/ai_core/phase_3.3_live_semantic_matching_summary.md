# Phase 3.3 Summary: Live Semantic Matching Upgrade

## 1. Phase 3.3 Overview

-   **Goal:** To upgrade the AI Core by implementing a live, Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic matching capability. This enables the system to dynamically understand the meaning of form field labels encountered on diverse websites by mapping them to a predefined, comprehensive schema of semantic keys, replacing the MVP's hardcoded, site-specific approach.
-   **Scope:** This phase included:
    -   Research into LLM and prompt engineering strategies suitable for semantic classification of form field labels.
    -   Definition and creation of a standardized `semantic_field_schema.json` containing a wide range of keys for user profiles and job application fields.
    -   Development of a new Python module, `live_semantic_matcher.py`, to interface with a live LLM (e.g., Gemini Pro) for this task.
    -   Creation of a strategy document for testing the live semantic matcher and iteratively refining its prompts and context usage.
    -   Integration of this new live semantic matching capability into the `MVCOrchestrator`'s AI processing pipeline, following the live visual perception and live visual grounding steps.

## 2. Key Modules and Developments

**2.1. `docs/ai_core/live_semantic_matching_research.md`**
-   **Summary:** This document detailed the selection considerations for LLMs (Gemini Pro, PaLM 2, GPT series) suitable for the text classification task inherent in semantic matching. It explored crucial aspects of context provision (visual label, predicted field type, target semantic key schema, optional DOM attributes/text) and outlined various prompt engineering strategies. These included zero-shot prompting (with detailed instructions and JSON output formatting), few-shot prompting (as an enhancement for ambiguity), techniques for handling ambiguous labels using additional context, and methods for dealing with out-of-schema fields (instructing the LLM to return a `null` or designated "other" key). The expected JSON output format (`{"semantic_key": "...", "confidence_score": ...}`) was also defined.

**2.2. `app/common/data_schemas/semantic_field_schema.json` (New Schema File)**
-   **Summary:** A new JSON file was created to house the standardized list of semantic keys. This schema is central to the new semantic matching approach.
    -   It includes a flat list, `target_semantic_keys`, designed for direct inclusion in LLM prompts (e.g., `user.personal_info.first_name`, `application.work_authorization.requires_visa_sponsorship`, `system_internal.other_unspecified_field`).
    -   It also contains a `schema_structure_description` which provides a human-readable, categorized view of the keys, aiding understanding and future maintenance.
    -   The schema covers user profile information (personal, contact, address, education, work experience, skills, documents) and application-specific details (job info, work authorization, availability, salary, references, EEO, custom questions, legal consents).

**2.3. `app/ai_core/live_semantic_matcher.py` (New Module)**
-   **Purpose:** This module takes `IdentifiedFormField` objects (which have already been processed by visual perception and visual grounding) and uses a live LLM to assign a `semantic_meaning_predicted` to each field by mapping its label and other context to a key from the loaded `semantic_field_schema.json`.
-   **Key Functions:**
    -   `_load_target_semantic_keys()`: A cached function (`@functools.lru_cache`) to load and parse the `semantic_field_schema.json` file once, returning the `target_semantic_keys` list.
    -   `_configure_gemini_semantic()`: Manages one-time API configuration for this module.
    -   `get_semantic_match_for_field()`: The core function that:
        -   Constructs a detailed prompt for the LLM (e.g., Gemini Pro), including the visual label, predicted field type, optional HTML attributes, the full list of target semantic keys, and instructions for the desired JSON output (`{"semantic_key": "...", "confidence_score": ...}`).
        -   Conditionally calls the live LLM API (if `live_llm_call=True`) or uses a hardcoded simulated response for testing.
        -   Parses the LLM's JSON response, including extraction from markdown code fences if necessary, and validates the output structure.
    -   `annotate_fields_with_semantic_meaning()`: Iterates over a list of `IdentifiedFormField` objects, calls `get_semantic_match_for_field` for each, and updates the field's `semantic_meaning_predicted` and `confidence_score` attributes based on the LLM's output. The field's confidence score is updated to reflect the LLM's confidence in the semantic match.
-   **Configuration:** Uses the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable and the `SEMANTIC_SCHEMA_PATH` constant.

**2.4. `docs/ai_core/live_semantic_matching_testing_notes.md`**
-   **Summary:** This document outlines a systematic strategy for testing and iteratively refining the `live_semantic_matcher.py` module. It includes:
    -   Hypothetical test cases covering diverse field label scenarios (synonyms, ambiguity, cultural specificity, long descriptions, no-match cases).
    -   Anticipated LLM challenges and corresponding prompt/context refinement techniques.
    -   A developer workflow involving test data collection, cached re-runs for prompt tuning, and logging.
    -   Success criteria focusing on accuracy and reliability of confidence scores.

**2.5. `app/orchestrator/mvp_orchestrator.py` Integration**
-   **Summary:** The `_call_ai_core` method within the `MVCOrchestrator` was updated to integrate the new live semantic matching capability:
    1.  The pipeline steps for DOM detail extraction, live visual perception (LLM-based), and live visual grounding (heuristic-based) remain as established in Phase 3.2.
    2.  The `grounded_form_fields` (output from `live_visual_grounder.py`) are now passed to `live_semantic_matcher.annotate_fields_with_semantic_meaning(..., live_llm_call=True)`. This replaces the previous call to the MVP's hardcoded semantic matching function.
    3.  The `semantically_matched_fields`, now annotated with live LLM-derived semantic meanings and confidence scores, are then used by the existing `mvp_generate_text_fill_actions` function to determine which user profile data to use for populating fields.
    -   The CLI display in the orchestrator was updated to show the semantic key assigned by the live matcher and the associated confidence score. Logging was also enhanced to reflect this new step.

## 3. Summary of Achievements in Phase 3.3

-   **Live LLM-Driven Semantic Matching:** Successfully developed and integrated a capability to understand the meaning of form fields on diverse web pages using live LLM calls, a significant advancement over the MVP's static, hardcoded approach.
-   **Comprehensive Semantic Schema:** Created a detailed and extendable `semantic_field_schema.json` that provides a standardized vocabulary for user profile attributes and common job application fields. This schema is central to the LLM's classification task.
-   **Enhanced AI Core Pipeline:** The AI Core pipeline within the `MVCOrchestrator` now performs: Live Page Analysis (DOM details) -> Live Visual Perception (LLM) -> Live Visual Grounding (Heuristics) -> Live Semantic Matching (LLM).
-   **Strategic Testing Framework:** Established clear strategies for the ongoing testing and iterative refinement of LLM prompts and context provision for semantic matching.

## 4. Current State and Known Limitations

-   **Live Semantic Matching is Active:** The system can now dynamically interpret the meaning of many field labels on previously unseen websites, provided the `semantic_field_schema.json` covers the concept. The accuracy of this step is dependent on the LLM's capabilities, the quality of the prompt, the clarity of the schema, and the context provided.
-   **Accuracy and Robustness Require Iteration:** While functional, LLM-based semantic matching will require ongoing prompt tuning, potential incorporation of few-shot examples, and refinement of context provision strategies to achieve high accuracy and robustness across the vast variety of web forms. LLM-provided confidence scores will also need careful interpretation and potential calibration.
-   **Downstream Logic Still Partially MVP-Based:**
    -   **Action Generation:** The `mvp_generate_text_fill_actions` function, while now receiving more accurately understood fields, is still primarily designed for basic text field filling.
    -   **Complex UI Interactions:** Specific logic for interacting with complex elements like custom dropdowns, date pickers, file uploads (beyond identifying the field itself), and checkbox/radio button groups is not yet implemented in the action generation or grounding stages.
    -   **Question Answering:** A dedicated module for generating answers to open-ended questions (e.g., fields semantically matched to `application.custom_question_response_N`) is not yet implemented or fully integrated.
-   **Error Handling & Advanced Disambiguation:** Sophisticated error handling for semantic matching failures (e.g., when the LLM provides an invalid key despite instructions) and advanced context-based disambiguation are areas for continued refinement.

## 5. Next Steps (Leading to Phase 3.4 - Advanced Interactions & QA)

-   **A. Iterative Refinement of Semantic Matching (Ongoing & Immediate):**
    -   Execute the testing plan detailed in `live_semantic_matching_testing_notes.md`.
    -   Systematically test `live_semantic_matcher.py` with diverse real-world form field examples.
    -   Collect data, analyze LLM responses and assigned semantic keys, and iteratively refine prompts, context strategies, and potentially the `semantic_field_schema.json` itself to improve accuracy and coverage.
-   **B. Phase 3.4: AI Core Upgrade - Advanced Interaction Logic & Question Answering (QA):**
    -   **Goal:** Enhance the system's ability to interact with a wider range of UI elements and to intelligently handle open-ended questions.
    -   **Advanced Interaction Logic:**
        -   Develop specific modules or functions to handle interactions with complex elements (e.g., selecting values in various types of dropdowns, choosing dates from date pickers, managing file uploads, ensuring correct selection in checkbox/radio groups). This will likely require more detailed analysis of `actual_dom_elements_details` for these specific elements.
    -   **Question Answering (QA) Implementation:**
        -   Develop `live_question_answering.py` (based on the earlier conceptual `question_answering_module.py`).
        -   This module will take an `IdentifiedFormField` (that has been grounded and semantically matched to a "question" type key), the full user profile, and potentially other context.
        -   It will use an LLM (e.g., Gemini Pro, PaLM 2) to generate a draft answer.
        -   Integrate this into the `MVCOrchestrator`, including a step for user review and approval of drafted answers before they are used to fill fields.
-   **C. Subsequent Phases:**
    -   Continued refinement of all AI Core modules (Perception, Grounding, Semantics, QA, Action Generation).
    -   Development of a more sophisticated Orchestration Engine capable of handling multi-page applications dynamically, managing errors robustly, and utilizing the full spectrum of AI Core outputs.
    -   User interface (UI) development for user interaction, review, and configuration.
    -   Overall system testing, performance optimization, and production-readiness preparations.

Phase 3.3 has successfully empowered the AutoApply system with a dynamic understanding of form field meanings. The immediate next steps involve rigorously testing and refining this new capability, followed by extending the system's ability to interact with more complex form elements and to generate answers for qualitative questions.
