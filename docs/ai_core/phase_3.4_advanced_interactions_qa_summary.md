# Phase 3.4: Advanced Interactions & Question Answering - Summary

## 1. Overview

Phase 3.4 of the AutoApply project focused on enhancing the AI's capability to handle more complex application form elements and to intelligently answer open-ended questions. This involved two main parts:

*   **Part A (Conceptual - Advanced Interactions):** Research and conceptual design for handling UI elements like dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and date pickers. Initial implementation for some handlers was notionally completed.
*   **Parts B & C (Implemented - Question Answering):** Full research, implementation, integration, and testing strategy for a live Question Answering (QA) module.

This document summarizes the key achievements and outcomes of the implemented QA portion and references the conceptual work for advanced interactions.

## 2. Advanced Interaction Handling (Conceptual Summary - Part A)

*   **Research:** Investigated common complex UI elements found in job application forms.
*   **Data Structure Extension:** `ai_core_data_structures.py` was conceptually updated to include structures for options within fields (e.g., `FormFieldOption`) and more diverse `PredictedFieldType` and `ActionSequenceActionType` enums.
*   **Visual Perception Enhancement:** Prompt strategies for `live_visual_perception.py` were designed to better identify these complex elements and their options.
*   **Interaction Logic (`live_interaction_handler.py` - Conceptual):**
    *   A module named `live_interaction_handler.py` was planned to house the logic for interacting with these elements.
    *   Specific handlers for dropdowns (matching profile data to options) and checkboxes (binary choices based on profile or defaults) were conceptually designed.
*   **Orchestrator Integration (Conceptual):** The `mvp_orchestrator.py` was planned to incorporate calls to the `live_interaction_handler` to generate appropriate action sequences (e.g., `SELECT_DROPDOWN_OPTION`).

*Self-correction: The initial issue description stated that `live_interaction_handler.py` was implemented. However, exploration revealed this file was not present. The summary reflects its conceptual status based on the issue text.*

## 3. Question Answering (QA) Module (Implemented - Parts B & C)

This was the primary focus of the active implementation work in this phase.

### 3.1. Research & Strategy (`docs/ai_core/live_question_answering_strategy.md`)

A comprehensive strategy was developed, covering:
*   **Identifying Questions:** Using semantic keys (`application.custom_question.generic_response_1`, `application.cover_letter_text_final`, etc.) from `live_semantic_matcher.py`.
*   **Contextual Data:** Defining necessary inputs for the QA LLM:
    *   Question text itself.
    *   Relevant sections from user profile (`my_cv.json`).
    *   Job context (job title, company, description from `job_description.txt`).
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Outlining strategies for role definition, input structuring, output formatting, tone, and constraints for the LLM.
*   **Handling Missing Data:** Planning for scenarios where user profile lacks information, ensuring graceful fallback and user notification.
*   **Output Structure:** Utilizing the `QuestionAnsweringResult` data structure.

### 3.2. QA Module Implementation (`app/ai_core/live_question_answerer.py`)

*   A new module, `live_question_answerer.py`, was created.
*   **Core Function (`generate_answer_for_question`):**
    *   Takes question text, DOM path, semantic key, user profile, and job context as input.
    *   Configures and calls the Gemini Pro LLM.
    *   Implements prompt construction based on the defined strategy (differentiating between cover letters and other questions).
    *   Includes helper functions:
        *   `_configure_gemini_qa`: Sets up the API.
        *   `_load_user_profile`: Loads `my_cv.json`.
        *   `_load_job_description`: Loads `job_description.txt`.
        *   `_select_relevant_profile_sections`: A basic heuristic to extract key information from the profile for the LLM prompt.
    *   Returns a `QuestionAnsweringResult` object containing the draft answer, sources, and review flag.
*   **Simulated Mode:** Supports `live_llm_call=False` for testing without API calls.

### 3.3. Orchestrator Integration (`app/orchestrator/mvp_orchestrator.py`)

*   The `QuestionAnsweringResult` dataclass in `app/common/ai_core_data_structures.py` was updated with a `to_dict()` method.
*   The `mvp_orchestrator.py` was significantly modified:
    *   **`_call_ai_core` method:**
        *   After semantic matching, it now identifies fields that are questions.
        *   Calls `generate_answer_for_question` from the new QA module.
        *   The generated draft answers are temporarily added to a copy of the user's profile (`temp_user_profile_for_action_gen`). This allows `mvp_generate_text_fill_actions` to use these QA drafts when creating fill actions.
        *   The `fields_to_display` (for user review) now indicates values generated by QA (e.g., `[QA Draft]: ...`).
        *   The `final_recommendations` dictionary now includes `question_answers_to_review` for explicit display.
    *   **`AWAITING_USER_APPROVAL` state:**
        *   Updated to display the suggested QA answers (question and draft) to the user before they approve the automation.
        *   The prompt for user approval now clarifies that it includes applying the QA answers.

### 3.4. Testing Strategy (`docs/ai_core/phase_3.4_testing_notes.md`)

*   A detailed testing document was created, outlining:
    *   Environment setup (API keys, profile data, job descriptions, target forms).
    *   Test cases for:
        *   Correct identification of question fields.
        *   Contextual data loading (profile, job description).
        *   LLM answer generation quality (relevance, cover letter specifics, handling missing data, tone).
        *   Orchestrator integration (display of QA answers, use in action generation, approval workflow).
    *   Brief revisit of advanced interaction handler testing (conceptual).
    *   Considerations for refinement based on testing outcomes.
